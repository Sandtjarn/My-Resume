    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>A driven guy with a passion for technology and engines.
<br><br>
    I've always had a burning interest in cars and motorcycles, ever since I was little my dad introduced me to motorcycles as he and his friends rode sport bikes. Got to sit on the tank at a very early age on an Aprilia and that's probably where I got completely hooked...
    After that, the simple way to make me happy when I've been in a bad mood has been to take me out in the car or on the bike to go a little faster than allowed. Then when I grew up it was tuned mopeds and dirt bikes, which turned into cars and motorcycles.
    <br><br>
    The cars that have been most interesting have been the Japanese legends!
    Have also had an EVO, STI, R32 and my favorite of them all a Mazda RF-7 FD from the best year 1994 (When I was born).
    <br><br>
    The interest in technology has always been there as long as I can remember, always tried to have the latest in technology such as the latest game consoles, the best graphics cards and the latest phones. And then i also find my interest in building computers and understand the way they work.
    And it's somewhere here my long-term dream has been, to become self-employed in web development or system development. Have worked with complex machine lines that are controlled by an extreme amount of computers and PLCs. So through that way I have learned a lot about communication and programming.
    It is also through that way my service mindset has become so developed. I always want the customer to be satisfied and refuse to leave with a bad feeling. Which I will take with me into my new career.
    <br><br>
    My home life looks like this: I work and then come home to my wonderful partner and my little daughter who came into the world on September 16, 2024. And for the little one, it's also the right way to go.</p>
