        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        
        <ul class="Work-experience-list">
            <li class="work-experience-headline-list">Autoexperten June 2013 – August 2014</li>
            <p class="work-experience-description-list">Worked as a mechanic with vehicle service and vehicle repairs. Working with car repairs made me technical, I also learned to find my own solutions to problems that arose. Worked a lot under pressure which has made me stress-resistant.</p>

        <p class="work-experience-description-list">Worked as a setter for eccentric presses. Here I learned the basics of measurement technology and sheet metal processing. Learned to operate and set up a laser machine.</p>

        <p class="work-experience-description-list">Worked with CNC, Mazak's multiplex machines, bar and smart. Here I also received training in measurement technology, such as measuring thousandths, RA value and cc dimensions. From here I gained precision and accuracy, also cleanliness.</p>
        
        <li class="work-experience-headline-list">IRE Metall December 2017 – June 2018</li>
        <p class="work-experience-description-list">Worked as a group coordinator/team leader over the automation hall. Learned to take responsibility and take my own initiatives to improve and increase production, reduce complaints. Customer service and listening and working with people have been fundamental during the work.</p>
        
        <li class="work-experience-headline-list">Axelent AB June 2018 – April 2019</li>
        <p class="work-experience-description-list">Works as a traveling fitter. Assembly of storage and bicycle racks, etc. The work is very independent where you have to be prepared to make your own decisions. Coordination and planning are essential.</p>
        
        <li class="work-experience-headline-list">Din Maskin AB April 2019-Present</li>
        <p class="work-experience-description-list">Traveling service technician was the title at this place. Here I have worked with machines such as punching and laser machines, press brakes with robots from Fanuc for automation of production. Here I have grown both as a person and a technician. Lots of problem solving and tricky thinking.
        Started working with only service but then went into the acute side and travels all over Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Here you are faced with a variety of problems such as mechanical, electrical or communication errors between computers to the various accessories on the machines.
        What I have learned most from here is to always keep calm and try to think calmly even if the customer is breathing down your neck.
        My skills as a service technician and problem solver have grown enormously with mixed knowledge in most areas of production technology and equipment.
        Here I also hold training sessions for our customers such as offline programming in Simuleasy and AutoPol. Also trains the operators in machine training.
        So my experience and knowledge within Industry is very broad.</p></ul>
